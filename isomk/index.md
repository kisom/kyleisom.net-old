I was a computer science major at the 
[Colorado School of Mines](http://mines.edu). Due to some headaches with a 
previous employer, school is currently on hold. I now work in the computer 
security field as a security engineer, and next year I hope to begin taking 
some classes to begin finishing my degree. 

My PGP key ID is `0x63AD01BF` and can be pulled either from

Technical Interests
-------------------
Technical interests include general technomagery, networking and computer 
security, robotics and embedded hardware, spacecraft and orbital mechanics, 
virtual machines, infrastructure stuff, and just about anything involving 
how the world around me works. In particular: I hold the ability to 
visualize, design, and build devices to interact meaningfully with the world 
around me on par with magic, and though my explorations into electrical 
engineering have just begun, I hold great hope for the future. In addition, 
I still find it at once fascinating and mind boggling that through 
concoctions of metal, silicon, and glass we are able to communicate if not 
actually then virtually in real time literally across the world virtually 
face to face using webcams and microphones. 


Nontechnical
------------
I have generally a lot of the same generic, cliche interests as many other
people do - reading, philosophy, traveling, adventures, and so forth.
