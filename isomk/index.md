I was a computer science major at the 
[Colorado School of Mines](http://mines.edu). Due to some headaches with a 
previous employer, school is currently on hold. I now work in the computer 
security field as a security engineer, and next year I hope to begin taking 
some classes to begin finishing my degree. I am currently working as a
software security engineer.

Technical Interests
-------------------
* general technomagery
* network / computer security
* robotics and embedded hardware
* spaceflight and orbital mechanics
* virtual machines
* infrastructure architecture and engineering

Really, just about anything involving how the world around me works catches
my fancy. In particular: I hold the ability to visualize, design, and build 
devices to interact meaningfully with the world around me on par with magic, 
and though my explorations into electrical engineering have just begun, I 
hold great hope for the future. In addition, I still find it at once 
fascinating and mind boggling that through concoctions of metal, silicon, 
and glass we are able to communicate if not actually then virtually in real 
time literally across the world virtually face to face using webcams and 
microphones. 


Nontechnical
------------
I have generally a lot of the same generic, cliche interests as many other
people do - reading, philosophy, traveling, adventures, and so forth.
